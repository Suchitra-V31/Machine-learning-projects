# Machine-learning-projects
Machine Learning is an art of making computers learn.

It learns from the past data and create a model and predicts from the new data.

It can be classified into three types:

**1.Supervised learning** - learns from labels provided

**2.Unsupervised learning** - no labels are provided

**3.Reinforcement learning** - learn from the environment

This repository include various projects which performs classification and regression tasks and predicts the model.

It includes Data Preprocessing Techniques for making the data useful for creating Machine
Learning models.

Various ML algorithms were used to solve the problems with best accuracy and efficiency.
